In a folder always run 'git status' first, if it is not a local git repo then it will show some error otherwise it will show the condition of files in the git repo.
If it is not a git repo then run the command 'git init' this will initialize a git repository into the folder.
But the .git directory made by the above command is a hidden folder and thus it will be not visible directly in the ide or in the terminal by the 'ls' command thus we use 'ls -la' command to see even the hidden folders and files.Even to make this folder visible in the vs code e can use command 'ctrl+,' this will open settings and in the settings we can then make the .git folder unhidden.
Now even if a folder is initialized with git yhe corresponding changes in the files are not tracked to track them we need to add them in the staging area by running the command 'git add filename' or 'git add .' to add all the files in the directory to the staging area.
Now the changes made are all getting tracked but then we use the command 'git commit -m "commit message in imperative present"' this will make a record of the work from the last commit to this commit. For the firs commit the parent pointer points to the null and for the further commits parent pointer points to last commit
Now for every commit a separate id is provided with lot of other informations to access these informations we use 'git log' for long form of id or use 'git log --oneline' for one line code.
